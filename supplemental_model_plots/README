This file contains supplementary plots made by the model code that are not included in the paper. 

The following plots show 2D density plots of each of the parameters binned from the Mathur et al. (2017) — M17 – sample. The colors of the bins correspond to the amount of stars in the bin.

Same as above but for the TRILEGAL sample.

The following plots show 2D density plots of the parameters binned from M17, but they differ from the plots above, in that they show the bin numbers on the X and Y axis. The colors of the bins correspond to the amount of stars in the bin.

P_histograms_compare_mathur_trilegal.png: This plot shows the effective temperature, surface gravity, and Kepler magnitude distributions for both M17 and the TRILEGAL overplotted. 
This plot shows the agreement we get from our three-parameter cross-match. 

P_histograms_final_trilegal_sample.png: This subplot of 12 histograms shows the distributon of the parameters in the final TRILEGAL sample. 

P_repeats_hist.png: This is a histogram of the amount of repeating stars seen in the TRILEGAL sample. i.e. the amount of times TRILEGAL had to repeat a star to fill a bin. 
The y-axis represents the number of stars that was repeated either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 times. Where 6 was the amount of times a star had to repeat in the sample. 
On this scale, the stars that had to be repeated 6 times is too small to see (2 times), and is represented by an arrow. 

P_repeats_scatter.png: This scatter plot shows the trilegal sample in Teff-log(g) space. Lines have been added to the plot to show the boundaries imposed on the sample by the S13 cuts. 
The purple stars have to repeat between 2 and 4 times to fill a bin, and the red triangles have to repeat greater than 5 times. 

P_g_dwarf_cut.png: The histogram on the left shows the effective temperatures of the G dwarfs in the sample and the histogram on the right shows the surface gravities. 
This plot contains all of the stars after the TRILEGAL sample is cut down to just include the G dwarfs based on the parameter restrictions given in S13. 

P_g_star_binary_cut.png: This plot is the same as above but with overplotted grey histograms to show the parameters of G dwarfs that were chosen to be binary stars. 
The shape of the grey histograms is evidence that the G stars were chosen at random, without replacement, from the original G dwarf sample. 

P_moe17_fig37.png: This plot is taken from Figure 37 of Moe and Di Stefano (2017) – Moe17 – and is placed in this GitHub for reference to our orbital period distribution only. 
The full paper for Moe17 can be found on arxiv at: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.05347.pdf. The distribution used for the orbital periods in this work corresponds to the red line on the bottom section of the plot. 

P_orbital_period_hist.png: This four histogram plot shows the process of assigning orbital periods from the distribution shown in the Moe17 plot shown in P_moe17_fig37.png.
The left hand plot shows the original data taken from the digitized version of the plot and the red data is the smooth interpolated function created from this data. 
The second plot shows a curve of the probability distribution function calcuated both manually and using a PDF module in Python, to check for errors in the code. 
The third plot shows a distribution of 100,000 stars normalized to the probability distribution as a sanity check for the code. 
The final plot shows the distribution of chosen orbital periods for the binary systems. 

P_mass_ratio_split.png: The sample is separated into two bins in order to allocate mass ratio based on the percentage of stars which should have a particular mass ratio (because the multiplicity fraction varies with mass ratio). 
This plot shows the distribution of effective temperature on the left and surface gravity on the right for both sections of the sample. This shows they were chosen randomly. 

P_moe17_table13.png: This is Table 13 taken from Moe17. The frequencies used, and cited, in this work are outlined. This table is uploaded to GitHub for reference only.

P_mass_ratio_small.png: These four plots show the distribution of mass ratios for small mass ratio allocations. 
The plot on the left shows the power law for the small mass ratios (0.1 - 0.3 M_comp/M_1), in the form of the probability distrbution. 
The second plot shows the cumulative density function for this power law. 
The third plot shows a test distribution for multiple stars with the probability function overplotted. 
The four plot is a histogram showing the mass ratios chosen at random for the systems in this sub-sample, drawn based on the probability distribution.
