This file contains supplementary plots made by the model code that are not included in the paper. 

The following plots show 2D density plots of each of the parameters binned from the Mathur et al. (2017) — M17 – sample. The colors of the bins correspond to the amount of stars in the bin.

Same as above but for the TRILEGAL sample.

The following plots show 2D density plots of the parameters binned from M17, but they differ from the plots above, in that they show the bin numbers on the X and Y axis. The colors of the bins correspond to the amount of stars in the bin.
