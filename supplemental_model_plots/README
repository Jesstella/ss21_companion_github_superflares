This file contains supplementary plots made by the model code that are not included in the paper. 

The following plots show 2D density plots of each of the parameters binned from the Mathur et al. (2017) — M17 – sample. The colors of the bins correspond to the amount of stars in the bin.

Same as above but for the TRILEGAL sample.

The following plots show 2D density plots of the parameters binned from M17, but they differ from the plots above, in that they show the bin numbers on the X and Y axis. The colors of the bins correspond to the amount of stars in the bin.

P_histograms_compare_mathur_trilegal.png: This plot shows the effective temperature, surface gravity, and Kepler magnitude distributions for both M17 and the TRILEGAL overplotted. 
This plot shows the agreement we get from our three-parameter cross-match. 

P_histograms_final_trilegal_sample.png: This subplot of 12 histograms shows the distributon of the parameters in the final TRILEGAL sample. 

P_repeats_hist.png: This is a histogram of the amount of repeating stars seen in the TRILEGAL sample. i.e. the amount of times TRILEGAL had to repeat a star to fill a bin. 
The y-axis represents the number of stars that was repeated either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 times. Where 6 was the amount of times a star had to repeat in the sample. 
On this scale, the stars that had to be repeated 6 times is too small to see (2 times), and is represented by an arrow. 

P_repeats_scatter.png: This scatter plot shows the trilegal sample in Teff-log(g) space. Lines have been added to the plot to show the boundaries imposed on the sample by the S13 cuts. 
The purple stars have to repeat between 2 and 4 times to fill a bin, and the red triangles have to repeat greater than 5 times. 

P_g_dwarf_cut.png: The histogram on the left shows the effective temperatures of the G dwarfs in the sample and the histogram on the right shows the surface gravities. 
This plot contains all of the stars after the TRILEGAL sample is cut down to just include the G dwarfs based on the parameter restrictions given in S13. 

P_g_star_binary_cut.png: This plot is the same as above but with overplotted grey histograms to show the parameters of G dwarfs that were chosen to be binary stars. 
The shape of the grey histograms is evidence that the G stars were chosen at random, without replacement, from the original G dwarf sample.
